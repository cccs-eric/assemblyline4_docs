# Signature
The Signature model is a comprehensive representation of a security signature within the Assemblyline malware analysis tool. It encapsulates a broad range of information crucial for the identification, classification, and operational management of malware signatures. Users can expect to find details such as the signature's unique name, its sensitive classification level, origin, and the specific data pattern used for malware detection. Additionally, the model tracks vital metadata like the versioning of a signature through its revision system, as well as the history of modifications and state changes, for rigorous record-keeping.

The Signature model also includes statistical data that reflects signature performance, contributing to informed decision-making regarding its efficacy and deployment. The classification of the signature's operational status is concisely represented, indicating whether it is actively deployed, undergoing testing, or marked as stale.


| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| classification | Classification | Indicates the sensitivity level of the signature, which dictates who can access it based on their clearance. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `TLP:C` |
| data | Text | Stores the actual signature data or pattern used for malware detection. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `None` |
| last_modified | Date | Records the timestamp of the most recent update to the signature. Defaults to the current time when the signature is modified. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `NOW` |
| name | Keyword | A unique and descriptive name for the signature. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `None` |
| order | Integer | **TODO**:Lower number means higher priority?  **Generated**:Determines the processing order of the signature relative to others. A lower number indicates higher priority. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `1` |
| revision | Keyword | Tracks the version of the signature, with the default starting value set to "1". | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `1` |
| signature_id | Keyword | A unique identifier for the signature, which can be used for tracking and referencing purposes. | <div style="width:100px">:material-minus-box-outline: Optional</div> | `None` |
| source | Keyword | Identifies the origin or the entity that provided the signature. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `None` |
| state_change_date | Date | Captures the date when the signature's status was last updated.  | <div style="width:100px">:material-minus-box-outline: Optional</div> | `None` |
| state_change_user | Keyword | Records the username of the individual who last modified the signature's status. | <div style="width:100px">:material-minus-box-outline: Optional</div> | `None` |
| stats | [Statistics](/odm/models/statistics/#statistics) | Holds various statistical data related to the signature's performance and usage | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | See [Statistics](/odm/models/statistics/#statistics) for more details. |
| status | Enum | Reflects the operational state of the signature, indicating whether it is deployed, in testing, or otherwise.<br>Supported values are:<br>`"DEPLOYED", "DISABLED", "INVALID", "NOISY", "STAGING", "TESTING"` | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `None` |
| type | Keyword | Specifies the category or classification of the signature, which can be used for organizing and filtering signatures. | <div style="width:100px">:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes</div> | `None` |
