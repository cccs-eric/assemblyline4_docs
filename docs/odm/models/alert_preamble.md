# Alert model preamble
The Alert object model, as defined in this documentation, specifies the structured representation of alert data within the Assemblyline application's Alert index. Each field delineated in the schema is an attribute of the Alert document, characterized by its data type, semantic definition, mandatory status, and default instantiation value.

Comprehension of this schema is pivotal for the construction of targeted Lucene search queries, which are instrumental in the interrogation and retrieval of alert-specific data from Assemblyline's analytical output. The schema's fields provide the analytical lexicon necessary to query and dissect alert data, facilitating the isolation of alerts based on defined parameters such as threat identifiers, heuristic evaluations, and temporal metadata.

This schema serves as a technical blueprint for cybersecurity professionals to navigate Assemblyline's alerting system, enabling refined query strategies and data extraction methodologies that align with operational cybersecurity imperatives and threat intelligence workflows.
